Difference b/w CPU and I/O operation
Define Concurrent and Parallel Programming





Best Practices
 1. Always use async and await together
 2. Always return a Task from an asynchronous method
 3. Always await an asynchronous method to validate the operation
 4. Use async and await all the way up the chain
 5. Never use async void unless it's an event handler or delegate
 6. Never block an asynchronous operation by calling Result or Wait()

You'll know how to effectively apply asynchronous and parallel programming


Note : The **WebClient** provides a way for us to synchronously go and download a string from a particular web API.

Executing long running synchronous operations on the UI thread will lock up the application.
